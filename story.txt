This is my story.
Dylan Torrance ’18

I am from Princeton, New Jersey,
a small town with people of all cultures
a friendly, student filled community

I am from a quiet road near the town,
I walk to get fresh bread and ice cream
I smell the odor of chlorine from the pool,
and see smiling faces lit up by fireworks.

I am from lasagna during the holidays,
dry ice volcano cake for birthdays,
Sophia making cookies for friends,
and a few of them always going missing.

I am from “Always take pride in your work,” 
and, “Respect, responsibility, and resiliency.”
On the weekends I hear “The library’s open”
and “Would you play some Mozart for us.”

I am from Mom, Dad, and Sophia,
East and West coast Grandparents
Aunts, Uncles, Cousins and friends.
