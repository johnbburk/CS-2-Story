This is my story.
<<<<<<< HEAD
There was once a projector named dan. He was a good projetor. He always projected a clear, precise image. Then one day he was taken to the great outdoors. There were many people around him. It all went by in a flash. Then, before he knew it, he was back in the classroom. But, this time something was differnet. His picure was blury and out of focus. Everyone was yelling at him. Dan was sad.

Dis be mah change.
